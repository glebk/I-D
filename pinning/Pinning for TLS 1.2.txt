- Server sends the extension unencrypted.
- Must ensure that the extensions are covered by both Finished messages.
- The server can only send the ticket when the master key is ready, i.e. just before it sends ChangeCipherSpec.
- The secret (ticket_secret) is derived from the master key plus the two randoms. Although for 1.3 we only use xES and xSS?
- The proof is similar to 1.3.
- Privacy is different: an exteral observer will see the returned ticket, so will be able to correlate the client's identity.
